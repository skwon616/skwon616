### 👋 Hi, I'm Steve — Aviation Operations Specialist & Data Science Engineer in Training  

I currently work as an **Apron Controller at Incheon International Airport**, where I manage aircraft ground movements and support airside safety operations.  
My core interest is **transforming complex aviation operations into interpretable data insights** using analytics, machine learning, and automation.

### 🔍 What I’m Working On
- ✈️ **Aviation Data Science**: Building ML/analytics workflows that model airport operations, delays, de-icing queues, and congestion patterns  
- 🧠 **LLM & Applied AI**: Taking Coursera's *IBM Data Science* and *Large Language Models* specialization to apply AI to real operational challenges  
- 🎓 **AI Data Science Program @ Korea Cyber University**  
- 📊 **Thesis on Airport Scheduling Optimization** using concepts from *Robust Gate Assignment* and airport capacity management  

### 🛠 Tech & Tools
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **SQL** (Certified SQL Developer – Korea Data Agency)  
- **Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling**  
- **LLM Prompt Engineering & Applied AI**  
- **Air Traffic Data Analysis & Simulation**

### 📘 Recent Projects
- 🧊 *De-icing Operation Delay Forecasting* using queueing models + ML  
- 🚦 *Airside Congestion Visualization* using Python & SQL  
- 🛫 *Airport Delay Patterns Dashboard* (Traffic peaks / slots / ATFM impact)  
- 🗄️ *Flight Movement Data Automation* with Python + MySQL  
- 📐 *Robust Gate Assignment Modeling* for academic research

### 🎯 Career Direction
My goal is to become an **Aviation Data Scientist** who connects operational expertise with data-driven decision-making.  
I am especially interested in:
- ✈️ Airport operations analytics  
- 🛰️ Air traffic flow management & predictive modeling  
- 📡 Safety, performance, and scheduling optimization  
- 🧩 Applying AI/LLMs to aviation workflows
